## 2026-04-05 Dice Roller App
- What was built: A single-file dice roller game with a Roll button, Unicode die face display, numeric result, and a rolling history of the last 10 rolls. Dark theme, mobile-first layout matching button-test style.
- Files modified:
  - `games/dice-roller/index.html` (new) — the complete app
  - `tests/qa-smoke.spec.ts` — added "Dice Roller App" test.describe block
- Tests added:
  - "page loads with correct heading" — verifies 200 status and h1 text
  - "clicking roll produces a number 1-6 and updates history" — clicks roll twice, verifies both results are 1-6, verifies history has at least 2 entries, logs values for debugging
  - "no JS errors on page" — loads page, clicks roll, checks for JS errors
- Assumptions:
  - Used Unicode dice characters (U+2680 to U+2685) for die faces — these render on all modern browsers/phones
  - History shows most recent roll first
  - History capped at 10 entries as specified
- Things the reviewer should check:
  - Unicode dice characters render correctly at the chosen font size
  - History items wrap properly on narrow (390px) screens
  - The #result element contains only the numeric value (no extra text) for test compatibility
