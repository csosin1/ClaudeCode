Append an entry when something breaks in a way that wasn't obvious from the code. Builders and Reviewers read this before starting a task.

## 2026-04-13 — patchright evaluate() runs in an isolated world

- **What went wrong:** Wrote a fingerprint unit test that set `window.__fp = result` from a `<script>` tag in the page, then read it back via `await page.evaluate(() => window.__fp)`. Always returned `undefined`, even though `document.title` (set on the same line) reflected the change.
- **Root cause:** Patchright (and Playwright with `useWorld: 'utility'`) runs `page.evaluate` in an *isolated* world — the same DOM, but a separate JS global object. `window.__fp` set in the page's main world is NOT visible to `evaluate`. Patchright does this by default to avoid the CDP `Runtime.enable` leak.
- **What to do differently:** When a fixture script must communicate with Node, write to a DOM attribute (`document.body.setAttribute('data-fp', JSON.stringify(out))`) and read it from Node via `page.getAttribute('body', 'data-fp')`. DOM is shared; window globals are not.

## 2026-04-13 — Object.defineProperty on Navigator.prototype isn't enough alone

- **What went wrong:** Stealth init script used `Object.defineProperty(Navigator.prototype, 'hardwareConcurrency', { get: () => 12 })` to spoof CPU count. Page still saw `2` (the patchright-injected value).
- **Root cause:** Navigator instances can have own-properties that shadow the prototype. Patchright (and likely Playwright itself) installs an own-property on `navigator` for some fields. A prototype-only override loses to an own-property.
- **What to do differently:** Always override at BOTH levels — `Object.defineProperty(Navigator.prototype, name, ...)` AND `Object.defineProperty(navigator, name, ...)` — and make both `configurable: true` so the second call doesn't throw. Helper:
  ```js
  const defNav = (name, value) => {
    try { Object.defineProperty(Navigator.prototype, name, { get: () => value, configurable: true }); } catch(e){}
    try { Object.defineProperty(navigator, name, { get: () => value, configurable: true }); } catch(e){}
  };
  ```

## 2026-04-13 — `addInitScript` + `+`-concatenated try/catch is fragile

- **What went wrong:** Built the stealth init script as one giant `'try { ... ' + 'foo;' + 'bar;' + '} catch(e){}'` string concatenation. Page silently ignored the script — `window.__stealthApplied = true` (the very first statement) was never set, but no error surfaced because `addInitScript` swallows page-side syntax errors silently.
- **Root cause:** The script had a syntax error (a try without a matching catch on the same logical line) but `addInitScript` runs the script via `eval`-style injection and a syntax error means *the whole script never runs*, with no error propagated to Node. There's no console listener early enough to catch it either.
- **What to do differently:** (1) Build the init script as a single template literal with real newlines, not string concatenation. (2) Always validate the generated script's syntax in Node BEFORE injecting: `try { new Function(scriptStr); } catch(e) { throw new Error('init script syntax: ' + e.message); }`. (3) Add a marker statement at the very top of the init script (`window.__stealthApplied = true`) so tests can verify the script ran at all, separately from verifying individual patches.

## 2026-04-13 — concurrent agent sessions racing on a shared git worktree

- **What went wrong:** Mid-edit, the local branch repeatedly reset itself, files reverted to older content, and `cd` between bash invocations would land on a different branch than the prior command was on. Ate ~30k tokens of unnecessary cherry-picks and stash dances.
- **Root cause:** Multiple parallel Claude sessions were running in different tmux windows against the same `/opt/site-deploy/` worktree. Each session was checking out its own branch, blowing away in-flight work in the other sessions' working tree.
- **What to do differently:** Long multi-file edits in shared-worktree environments should (a) commit-and-push aggressively after each logical chunk so origin survives the race, (b) use `git worktree add` to spin up a per-session worktree, or (c) do all writes + commit in one atomic Bash invocation chained with `&&`. Option (a) is the cheapest and worked here.
